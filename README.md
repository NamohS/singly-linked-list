# singly-linked-list

1] [Singly list basic](list.cpp)
This C++ program creates a simple linked list using a Node class and demonstrates the basics of working with linked lists. It creates a linked list of four nodes, displays information about each node, and then traverses and prints the entire linked list. This is a fundamental example of linked list implementation in C++.

  <img src="node1.png" width="17.5%" height="17.5%"/>
</div><br/>

2] [List Addition](addinlist.cpp)
This C++ program demonstrates the implementation of a singly linked list with basic operations, including inserting elements at the beginning and end of the list. It also displays the linked list at different stages, providing a clear example of how linked lists work in C++.
<div align="left">
  <img src="node2.png" width="17.5%" height="17.5%"/>
</div><br/>

3] [List with menu](menuwithlist.cpp)

This C++ program allows the user to interactively create and manipulate a singly linked list. It provides options to add data to the list at the beginning or end and to display the list's contents. The program's menu-driven approach makes it a practical example of creating and working with linked lists in C++.

<div align="left">
  <img src="node3.png" width="17.5%" height="17.5%"/>
</div><br/>
