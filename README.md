# singly-linked-list

1] [Singly list basic](list.cpp)
This C++ program creates a simple linked list using a Node class and demonstrates the basics of working with linked lists. It creates a linked list of four nodes, displays information about each node, and then traverses and prints the entire linked list. This is a fundamental example of linked list implementation in C++.
